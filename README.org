#+title: Statistical analysis of microbial data from many oceanographic cruises


** Summary
This repository contains the workflow for analyzing microbial data (measured by
flow cytometry) from multiple oceanographic cruises, using the flowmix model
([[https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11251][preprint]] and [[https://github.com/sangwon-hyun/flowmix][software]]).

The Seaflow project at the University of Washington generated the flow cytometry
data ([[https://seaflow.netlify.app/][website]]):

Environmental data comes from the Simons CMAP database [[https://simonscmap.com/]].

** Installation and usage
The scripts named e.g. ~00-covariates.Rmd~ are to be run in order of the numbers
on the filenames. The relevant data files and outputs are placed in an
identically named directory called ~00-covariates~.
